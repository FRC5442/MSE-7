# MSE-7
FRC 5442 2020 robot code.

The MSE-6-series repair droid, sometimes referred to as the mouse droid, was a small, box-shaped, wheeled general purpose MSE-series droid often used for delivery and maintenance purposes. MSE-6 units were most notably on Star Destroyers and both Death Stars during the time of the Galactic Empire.

This MSE-7-series is the newest innovation in repair droid technology, featuring a power cell intake mechanism, the capabilities to fire these power cells over large distances, clearing any obstacle in the way, and the mobility to translate and rotate on the floor with ease.
